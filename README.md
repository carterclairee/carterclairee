# Well hello, I'm Claire! 👋
I'm a teacher-turned-technical-writer-turned-full-stack-developer. My journey has been fueled by curiosity, creativity, and my love of problem solving. I'm always building and creating things, whether it be with code or with words. I recently finished my full stack development bootcamp at Codeop, where I added to my SQL knowledge and learned Javascript, React, CSS, Node.js, and Vue, along with other tools. I like to build my own projects that solve real problems for me, so you'll see plenty of knitting, cooking, and hiking apps! I'm also so excited to contribute to collaborative projects and work with other coders and designers. Projects that particularly catch my interest are those that help users make sustainable choices, save money, and pursue their interests in new and fun ways.

## A little about me
🔎 Find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/claire-carter-e).

🔧 I'm currently working on adding some new features to my full stack fiber arts app, [Use Your Stash](https://github.com/carterclairee/use-your-stash). It's an app for knitters and crocheters to keep track of their yarn and matches yarn to patterns to help reduce waste and save money.

🌱 Right now, I'm learning more about front end optimization.

## Beyond code
I'm a mom of two darling kids and two adorable cats. I'm jumping back into the world of more traditional work after being a full stack caregiver. You know, responsible for both the front end and the back end 👶. Some things I like other than coding:

✈️ Adventures and travel, and my next trip is going to be to Japan for the second time.

🍄 Long nature walks, especially during mushroom season to see what's growing. I haven't been bold enough to sample any yet, but I am confident in my chanterelle ID skills, should I stumble upon one.

🧶 Knitting sweaters and socks and the occasional crocheting of a blanket or stuffie.

📖 Reading anything really, but I'm always looking for my next historical fiction read.

🍽️ Cooking and meal planning dishes that are mostly healthy, kid- and grown-up-approved, and budget-friendly. It's an art! And maybe also a science. It was the inspiration for my project [Fridge to Fork](https://github.com/Ingersdotter/Fridge-to-Fork), a full stack app for making the most out of what's in your fridge and pantry by matching ingredients to recipes based on your diet.
