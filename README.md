# Well hello, I'm Claire! 👋
I'm a teacher-turned-technical-writer-turned-full-stack-developer. My journey has been fueled by curiosity, creativity, and my love of problem solving. I'm always building and creating things, whether it be with code or with words. 

## A little about me
🔎 Find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/claire-carter-e).

🔧 I'm currently working on adding some new features to my full stack fiber arts app, [Use Your Stash](https://github.com/carterclairee/use-your-stash). It's an app for knitters and crocheters to keep track of their yarn and matches yarn to patterns to help reduce waste and save money.

🌱 Right now, I'm learning more about front end optimization.

## Beyond code
I'm a mom of two darling kids and two adorable cats. I'm jumping back into the world of more traditional work after being a full stack caregiver. You know, responsible for both the front end and the back end 👶. Some things I like other than coding:

✈️ Adventures and travel, and my next trip is going to be to Japan for the second time.

🍄 Long nature walks, especially during mushroom season to see what's growing. I haven't been bold enough to sample any yet, but I am confident in my chanterelle ID skills, should I stumble upon one.

🧶 Knitting sweaters and socks and the occasional crocheting of a blanket or stuffie.

🪡 Sewing and designing sensory-friendly clothes for kids. My oldest is reallllly bothered by seams but loves a girlie princess dress. Challenge accepted!

📖 Reading anything really, but I'm always looking for my next historical fiction read.

🍽️ Cooking and meal planning dishes that are mostly healthy, kid- and grown-up-approved, and budget-friendly. It's an art! And maybe also a science. It was the inspiration for my project [Fridge to Fork](https://github.com/Ingersdotter/Fridge-to-Fork), a full stack app for making the most out of what's in your fridge and pantry by matching ingredients to recipes based on your diet.
